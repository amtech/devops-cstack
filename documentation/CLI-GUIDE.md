For use this application, you need to have installed before :

 - Available CloudUnit Manager 1.0
 - Java Runtime Environment 1.7 or more

## Download and launch the application

You can download the archive of application [here](https://github.com/Treeptik/CloudUnit/releases/download/1.0/cloudunitcli.zip).
Or use :
```bash

```

After download, you can launch the application by using these commands :
```bash
cd CloudUnit-CLI
mvn clean compile exec:java
```

You can run this application with Docker too :
```bash
docker run --rm -it cloudunit/cli
```

## Help

When the application is running, you can access to help with the command *help*. This command will display all commands available in CloudUnit-CLI.
```bash
cloudunit-cli> help
```
If you wanna have an help on a specific command, you can use *help* with command in argument :
```bash
cloudunit-DEV-myapp>  help connect
Keyword:                   connect
Description:               Connect to CloudUnit Host
 Keyword:                  login
   Help:                   Your login
   Mandatory:              true
   Default if specified:   '__NULL__'
   Default if unspecified: '__NULL__'

 Keyword:                  password
   Help:                   User password
   Mandatory:              false
   Default if specified:   '__NULL__'
   Default if unspecified: ''

 Keyword:                  host
   Help:                   Host for Cloudunit Platform
   Mandatory:              false
   Default if specified:   '__NULL__'
   Default if unspecified: ''

* connect - Connect to CloudUnit Host
```

If you give a pattern in argument, the *help* command provides you commands with this pattern : 
```bash
cloudunit-DEV-myapp>  help rm
* rm-alias - Remove an existing alias
* rm-app - Remove an application
* rm-module - Remove a module from the current application
* rm-snapshot - Remove the snapshot for the current application
```

## Connection

You can connect to the CloudUnit Manager with the command :
```bash
cloudunit-cli> connect --login johndoe 
Enter your password : 
*******
Trying to connect to default CloudUnit host...
Connection established
```
Default host is localhost(/127.0.0.1) but you can specify if you want an external host with the command :
```bash
cloudunit-cli> connect --login johndoe --host https://admin.cloudunit.dev
Enter your password : 
*******
Trying to connect to default CloudUnit host...
Connection established
```
Now you are in the DEV context.

## Application features

### Create

You can create an application with the command :
```bash
cloudunit-DEV> create-app --name name --type tomcat-7
Your application myapp is currently being installed
```
After this command, you are in the application context.

### Remove

You can delete an existing application : 
```bash
cloudunit-DEV-myapp>  rm-app --name test
test
Confirm the suppression of your application: test - (yes/y) or (no/n)
yes
Your application test is currently being removed
```

### Change context

When you have two or more applications created on CloudUnit, you can take control of an application with the command :

```bash
cloudunit-DEV-myapp>  use myapp2
Current application : myapp2
```

### Clone

**For this feature, you must have already created a snapshot.**
You can clone an existing application :
```bash
cloudunit-DEV-myapp>  clone --tag tag --applicationName myapp
Your application myapp2 was successfully created.
```

### Display

```

### Automating

If you wanna execute some commands in a file, you can use the command *script* :
```bash
cloudunit-cli> script --file ../../Connect.sh

```bash
cloudunit-DEV-myapp>  // Remove an application
cloudunit-DEV-myapp>  ; Remove an application
cloudunit-DEV-myapp>  rm-app --name myapp
myapp
Confirm the suppression of your application: myapp - (yes/y) or (no/n)
yes
Your application myapp is currently being removed
```

### Exit the shell

For exit CloudUnit-CLI and return the standard shell, you need to use this command : 
```bash

```bash
cloudunit-DEV-myapp>  disconnect
Disconnect
```

## Script exemple for create and deploy an application

This is an exemple of script which connect to an account, create an application, download a git repository, package it and deploy it on CloudUnit-CLI :

```bash
connect --login johndoe --password abc2015
create-app --name myapp --type tomcat-7
! git clone https://github.com/Treeptik/cloudunit-webapp-examples.git
! mvn clean package -f cloudunit-webapp-examples/spring-boot-mongodb/pom.xml
deploy --path cloudunit-webapp-examples/spring-boot-mongodb/
disconnect
```
Now, you'll just run the command :

```bash
cloudunit-cli> script --file /home/username/script.sh
```
